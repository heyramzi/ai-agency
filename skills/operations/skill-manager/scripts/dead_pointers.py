"""Find routing pointers that name a skill or agent which does not exist.

A registry routes by name in prose: "belongs to `clickup-ops`", "invoke `board-spec`".
Nothing resolves those, so a merged or deleted asset leaves every pointer at it intact and
silent. Found 9 Sep 2026: `project-manager` listed twelve skills and four of them had been
gone long enough that nobody could say when, `discovery-system` routed the build phase to a
skill that never shipped, and `hyperframes-lane` promised a migration skill that does not exist.

    python3 scripts/dead_pointers.py [ai-doc-root] [--extra name,name]

Exits 1 when anything is dead. Names outside `ai-doc/` (a consumer's own skills, a CLI, a
reference filename) are the false-positive class: pass them with `--extra`, and prefer that
over widening the regex, because a pointer this misses is a pointer nothing checks.
