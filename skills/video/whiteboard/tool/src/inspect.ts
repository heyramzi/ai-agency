 * WHY it exists: the relay stores nothing and `push` can only say what it sent,
 * so "drew 64 elements" and "the room holds 64 elements" were never the same
 * claim. A collaborator answers `new-user` by broadcasting its whole scene to
 * whoever just joined, so joining and listening is the one way to read the
 * canvas back. Element ids are deterministic and unique across the registry,
 * which is what turns that scene into a board list.
