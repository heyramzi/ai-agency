"""The rhythm of an edit: how often it cuts, how often the frame changes, how much is covered.

WHY THIS EXISTS: cutting a script is half an edit. The other half is the rhythm - how often the
frame changes, how much of the runtime hides the speaker behind something - and that half is
usually decided by watching the video and guessing. It is measurable off the same payload, so it
is measured here: `audit` reads the rhythm a cut already has, `plan` says where the next state
change belongs and which shot the line calls for.

THE CLOCK IS SPEED-ADJUSTED. `audioSegment.duration` is source time; a tau played at speed 1.05
occupies duration/1.05 on the timeline. One measured 7:34 lesson sums to 476.83s raw
and 454.54s adjusted, and 454.54 is what the API reports as the composition duration. Every second
printed here is the adjusted one.

IT READS THE PAYLOAD `dscript grab` ALREADY WROTE. The taus, the layout cards and the pinned
clips all live in it, under `data[0]` as `copiedTaus`, `copiedComponents` and `pinTracks`. A
project document exported some other way works too, under `compositions[].timeline`.
