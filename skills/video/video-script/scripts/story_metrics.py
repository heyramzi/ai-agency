"""Measure the story mechanics of a script or a transcript, deterministically.

WHY this exists: every rule in `storytelling`, `video-hooks` and `video-script` about seams,
hedges, contrast and prediction was checkable by eye and therefore checked differently every
time. This puts one number on each of them, with the offending sentence attached, so a review
argues with a measurement instead of with an impression.

What it does NOT do is judge. It counts. A high hedge count on a provenance-heavy script is
correct; the thresholds that turn a count into a verdict live in `video-coach`,
`references/checks.md`, calibrated against the 627-video corpus.

Pronouns are deliberately absent: `video-coach/scripts/take-stats.py` owns first and second
person and this would be the second copy of that count.

    python3 story_metrics.py script.json --json          # {"blocks":[{"name","spoken"}...]}
    python3 story_metrics.py --corpus <competitor-intel/data> [--check]   # self-check

**The self-check is not a validity test and does not pretend to be one.** None of these axes
separates a winner from a control in the corpus, so there is no separation for it to preserve. What
it guards is calibration: each rule's fire rate across 627 videos, recorded when the thresholds
were set. A pattern tightened or loosened later moves those rates, and a rule that fires on 90% of
the niche or on none of it has stopped being a gate. `--check` exits 1 when a rate leaves its band.
