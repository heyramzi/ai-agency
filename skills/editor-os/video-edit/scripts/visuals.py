"""The shot pass's second half: the beats a trigger cannot see, read off the whole script.

`sequence.py plan` is pass 1 of the shots and it is deterministic: six triggers, each of
them a surface pattern - a number in the line, a demonstrative phrase, a contrastive
opener, or dead air. What no pattern finds is a sentence that is well formed, carries no
number and names a STRUCTURE, which is most of what a graphic is for. The author, 8 Sep 2026,
on EA20 at 12:09 - "so that ClickUp, your project tool, could talk to Notion, your
documentation tool" - asked why the plan had put a zoom there: "why isn't the descript
skill smart enough to know that this is a visual context?" It is not, and it cannot be:
the line has no digit in it, so the `motion` trigger never fires and `zoom` takes the
stretch as dead air.

So the shots get the same two-pass shape the cuts got: a script enumerates what a script
can find, and a read finds the rest.

    python3 visuals.py brief doc.json --out visuals.txt   # the reader's input
    python3 visuals.py check doc.json briefs.json         # resolve what came back
    python3 visuals.py check doc.json briefs.json --plan pins.json   # and against pass 1

The brief the reader runs on is in `references/sequencing.md`. Exit status is 1 when a
brief does not resolve, or when `--plan` finds the plan is mostly zooms.
