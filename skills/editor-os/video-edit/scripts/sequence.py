"""The rhythm of an edit: how often it cuts, how often the frame changes, how much is covered.

WHY THIS EXISTS: `pins.py` places a clip and `layout apply` stamps a look, but nothing decided
WHERE either belongs, so the cut half of the edit was automated and the shot half stayed manual.
This reads the rhythm off a finished edit (`audit`) and proposes the next one from the surviving
script (`plan`), in the pins.json shape `pins.py` already consumes.

THE CLOCK IS SPEED-ADJUSTED. `audioSegment.duration` is source time; a tau played at speed 1.05
occupies duration/1.05 on the timeline. ES02 sums to 476.83s raw and 454.54s adjusted, and 454.54
is what `get_project` reports. Every second printed here is the adjusted one.

BOTH HOMES OF THE SAME SHAPES. A `doc.json` from the CLI keeps them under
`compositions[].timeline`; the clipboard payload `dscript grab` writes keeps the identical
structures under `data[0]` as `copiedTaus`, `copiedComponents` and `pinTracks`. Either one works,
so the rhythm can be read without a second tool in the loop.

    sequence.py audit <doc.json|grab.json> [--comp N]        what rhythm this edit actually has
    sequence.py plan  <doc.json|grab.json> [--comp N] [--out pins.json]
    sequence.py balance <doc.json> [--comp N]                where the dressing sits, and the sound

    """Every pin on the timeline, as (start, end, lane), plus the runtime.

    FIVE LANES, read off the document rather than off a naming convention where one exists.
    A pin whose scene carries no media at all is a `title`: text is drawn on the card, not
    sourced. A pin whose media has audio and no picture is a `sound`. Everything else is a clip,
    and the house name splits it: a rendered graphic carries the timecode bracket it was rendered
    for (`36 [14-19] Sprint Comes Off`), footage does not. That bracket is already this skill's
    naming rule, so nothing new is being assumed here.

    THE FIFTH LANE IS `chrome`, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THE COUNT HONEST. A background
    plate and a progress bar are pinned scenes like any other, and a first run of this counted
    them: EC49 came back at 199% title and 83% footage, because a grid plate ran under all
    eighteen minutes and a progress HUD sat on 129 cards. So a scene earns a lane only where it
    sits ABOVE the camera on some card - below it is a plate - and only where it is wider than
    CHROME_W, which is what separates a lower third from a corner dot. Neither is a state change;
    the viewer stops seeing both inside ten seconds.

    A pin's visible span is its anchor card to its closing card. A pin with no closing card runs
    to the end of the video, and it is counted that way because that is what the viewer sees.
