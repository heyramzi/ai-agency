"""Enumerate pass-2 candidates: the sentences that are clean and carry nothing.

`candidates.py` enumerates pass 1, so pass 1 does not depend on an agent noticing
things. Pass 2 did, and that is why it gets skipped: a first-take lesson comes back
with zero wreckage left and every restatement still in it. This finds the four kinds
that a reader can check, so pass 2 is auditable the same way.

    python3 restate.py doc.json --comp "<name or id>"   # the live script from a doc dump
    python3 restate.py blocks.json                      # or a JSON array of strings
    python3 restate.py doc.json --check needles.json    # what the cut list does not cover

Exit status is 1 when --check finds an uncovered candidate. Every candidate is a
needle or a dismissal, and a dismissal is one word.

The four are the ones `references/cutting.md` names. `restate` is item 2, the same
idea in different words, which is the one that costs the most seconds and the one no
regex finds: it scores content-word overlap between sentences inside a window, so
`create a single source of truth` and `emphasizing on that single source of truth`
both surface. The other three are phrase lists, because they are phrases.
