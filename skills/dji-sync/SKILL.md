# DJI Sync

This skill starts when the recording stops and owns the card until it is empty. It does not
edit, trim, colour-grade or re-encode video. It swaps one audio track and gets out. Hands off
to `shorts-production` (encoding, filing and scheduling), `descript-projects` (getting footage
in), `video-hooks` and `generate-social` (hooks, scripts, captions), and to whatever note system
turns a filed voicenote into pages.

## Two paths off the same card

A take is either **half of a reel** or **a thought recorded alone**. They share the card
detection and the archive-and-wipe contract and nothing else.

| | Reel take | Solo take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Script | `dji_sync.py` | `dji_note.py` |
| Needs | an iPhone clip to pair with | nothing but the take |
| Output | `NAME-dji.MOV`, video bit-identical | speech-only `.opus` + a vault voicenote |
| Ranking rule | the video is the timeline | the transcript is the deliverable |

**Ask which one it is. Do not infer it silently.** The person who recorded it says so in plain
language ("that's a voice memo", "pair this with the reel") and that always wins. A wrong guess
either burns 20 minutes of thinking or destroys the audio half of a reel. When they have not said: no clip in
`~/Downloads` near the take's timestamp means solo; a long take that VAD reports as mostly
silence means solo, a walk with pauses; a take within seconds of a clip's length means reel.
Run `dji_note.py --dry-run` when unsure. It decides and reports without writing anything.

## The rule that ranks above the rest

**The video is the timeline.** The clip's duration, frame timing and metadata are the truth.
The DJI take is a raw ingredient: it gets trimmed, shifted and padded to fit the video, never
the other way round. Output duration always equals input duration. If that is not true, the
run failed.

Normally the mic is started first and stopped last, so the take fully contains the clip and
both ends get trimmed off. That is the expected case, not a guarantee. See "When the take
runs short".

## Never match on timestamps

The transmitter's clock and the phone's clock do not agree, and the drift is not constant.
On the first real pair the DJI filename stamped `190732` while the clip stamped `19:07:49`,
implying 17 s, and the true measured offset was 16.004 s. A second take on the same card was
stamped 90 s away from where its audio actually sat.

Filename stamps are worth using to *order* takes and nothing else. The waveform decides.

## How the match is decided

The pipeline aligns once globally with GCC-PHAT, then re-measures the offset independently in
every 2-second window: a genuine match holds the same offset everywhere, a false one wanders.
Alignment is sub-sample and drift is corrected when it matters. The measured evidence behind
the method (why envelope correlation and peak height fail, the drift numbers) is in
[references/matching-method.md](references/matching-method.md).

Accept requires **all** of: ≥ 80 % of windows within 1.0 ms of the median, each with
peak-to-sidelobe ≥ 5; a ≥ 15 percentage-point margin over the runner-up take; at least 2 usable
windows. Miss any and it refuses and writes nothing. A wrong take burned silently is far more
expensive than a refusal: you find it in the edit, an hour later. Do not loosen these to force
a match. Pass the take explicitly instead:
`dji_sync.py clip.MOV --take /path/to/TX00_MIC005.wav`.

## When the take runs short

The very first real pair covered **20.29 s of a 35.84 s clip**: the transmitter stopped before
the phone did. Assume it will happen again. Uncovered stretches are filled from the phone's own
audio, RMS-matched to the lav so the level does not jump, with a 40 ms crossfade at the seam.
The run prints a loud `WARNING` with the head and tail gap. `--silence-gaps` leaves them silent
instead, which makes the gap obvious in an edit at the cost of throwing away usable audio.

**Always read the coverage line.** A file at 57 % coverage is a usable rescue, not a clean take.

## What "no loss" means here

- **Video is never re-encoded.** `-c:v copy`, and the burn is rejected unless the output's video
  stream MD5 equals the source's. Bit-identical or it does not ship.
- **Audio is lossless.** ALAC `s32p` in the `.MOV`. Measured round-trip residual −143.3 dBFS,
  max 1.19e-7, which is float32's own epsilon rather than any codec loss.
- The only intentional changes to the lav samples are the sub-sample shift and the seam crossfade.

`--codec pcm` for older NLEs, `--codec aac` for a small upload copy. Both a step down for no
gain in an edit.

## Metadata and what survives

`-map_metadata 0 -movflags use_metadata_tags`, then `exiftool` restores the Apple keys ffmpeg
drops, then the file's mtime and creation date are reset to the original's. Verified preserved:
rotation (90°, both as the tag and the display matrix), `CreationDate` with its timezone, GPS,
`Make`/`Model`/`Software`, and the four `mebx` Core Media Metadata tracks with their handler
names. macOS parses the result natively.

**Known cosmetic wart:** ffprobe reports the data tracks' `codec_tag_string` as `stts` rather
than `mebx` after the remux. The handlers and payloads survive and macOS reads the file. If a
tool ever chokes on those tracks, drop them rather than shipping mangled ones.

## The solo path: silence goes before whisper sees it

Silence stripping is a correctness requirement, not a size optimisation: fed a mostly-silent
take, whisper loops on one sentence and the real content never appears. **Silero VAD decides**
what is speech; a fixed dB gate needs per-recording tuning and is only a cross-check. The
measured evidence for both claims is in
[references/matching-method.md](references/matching-method.md).

Everything else is defaults with a reason: 0.25 s of padding either side so words are not
clipped, joins de-clicked with a 10 ms fade, and silences shorter than 400 ms left in.

### The loop guard, which is the real safety net

The transcript is checked before anything is written or deleted. If one normalised sentence
accounts for 6 or more lines and 40% of the transcript, it is whisper looping, not the speaker
repeating themselves. The run refuses: no note, no wipe, card untouched, and it says to try a
lower `--vad-threshold`. Verified against both transcripts above: the trap trips at 38 of 42
lines, the real one passes at 1 of 11.

### Where the note lands

`Raw/Voicenotes/YYYY-MM-DD <Title>.md` in your notes vault (`--vault`), with the take id, both
durations and the audio path in frontmatter.

**Raw is immutable and the wiki is a separate act.** The script files the transcript and stops.
Turning it into pages is a separate ingest, one source at a time, with the person who recorded it
in the loop. Summarise the take back to them and ask what to emphasise before writing a single
page. Never quietly rewrite a plan from a walk.

Pass `--title` once the transcript has been read. Without it the note is filed under a
provisional `DJI note HHMM` and has to be renamed during the ingest.

### What the wipe destroys here

The reel path archives every take in full. **The solo path does not.** It archives the
speech-only Opus and deletes the source wav, which is irreversible: the 95% that was silence is
gone, and so is the untouched audio of the 5% that was not. The transcript must pass the loop
guard before anything is deleted, so the ordering still holds. When the raw take matters,
`--keep-original` archives the full wav through the same checksummed path the reel side uses.

## Running it

```bash
D=scripts
python3 "$D/dji_sync.py"                     # newest clip in ~/Downloads, detect card, burn, wipe
python3 "$D/dji_sync.py" --dry-run           # decide and report, touch nothing
python3 "$D/dji_sync.py" clip1.MOV clip2.MOV # several clips, each take used at most once
python3 "$D/dji_note.py" --dry-run --no-note # cut, transcribe, print, write nothing
python3 "$D/dji_note.py" --title "..."       # file the note, then wipe the card
```

`--no-clean` keeps the card as it is on either path.

Reel flags: `--take` to force the pairing, `--keep-scratch` to retain the phone audio as a
second track, `--silence-gaps`, `--codec`, `--archive DIR`, `--card PATH`, `--output PATH`.
Note flags: `--title`, `--vad-threshold` (0.5), `--min-silence-ms` (400), `--pad` (0.25),
`--bitrate` (24k), `--lang` (auto, so French and English both work), `--keep-original`,
`--no-note`, `--vault DIR`.

Reel output lands beside the source as `NAME-dji.MOV`. **The original is never modified**, so a
bad run costs nothing but disk. Note output lands in the day's archive folder and the vault.

### What it runs on

Both paths need `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` and numpy. The solo path also needs `whisper-cli` and
`whisper-vad-speech-segments` (`brew install whisper-cpp`), plus two models already on this
machine because VoiceInk downloaded them:

- `~/Library/Application Support/com.prakashjoshipax.VoiceInk/WhisperModels/ggml-large-v3-turbo-q5_0.bin`
- `/Applications/VoiceInk.app/Contents/Resources/ggml-silero-v5.1.2.bin`

Nothing is downloaded and nothing is sent anywhere: it is all local and free. **This borrows
another app's files**, so if VoiceInk is ever removed, copy both models somewhere stable and
point `--model` and `--vad-model` at them rather than re-downloading. A 20-minute take costs
about 26 seconds end to end on the M4 Pro.

## The card wipe, and the trap in it

Order is fixed and not negotiable: **burn → verify → archive → checksum → delete.** Every take
on the card is copied to `~/Movies/dji-archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` and each copy's SHA-256 is compared
against the original *before* anything is removed. A take whose checksum mismatches stays on
the card. If any clip in the run failed to verify, the card is left completely alone.

**Dragging takes to the Trash on a removable volume never frees the space.** They move to a
hidden `.Trashes` folder on the card and sit there. The first run found **31.5 MB** of takes
"deleted" that way. The wipe clears `.Trashes` explicitly, which is most of the point of
automating this.

## Verification

- [ ] New failure modes from this run appended to Learned Patterns

## Closing a run

This skill appends new failure modes to its own pattern list after each run. If this run surfaced one not already listed, append it to Learned Patterns before finishing. Keep the
measured number, not the impression.

## Learned Patterns

Appended when a run surfaces something this skill did not already know. Newest first.

- Whisper locks into a repeat loop when it is fed long near-silence, and the transcript
  looks plausible while being worthless. Cut to the spoken parts with VAD before
  transcribing, and refuse the run when one normalised sentence carries 40 per cent of
  the lines.
- Nearest duration is not a match. Two takes recorded minutes apart can be within a
  second of each other, so the waveform is the only honest test.
- Never re-encode the video to swap the audio. Stream-copy the picture and mux the new
  track, or a lossless job becomes a generation loss for nothing.
- Wipe the card only after the archive copy has been checksummed and read back. A
  successful write is not proof the file is readable.
