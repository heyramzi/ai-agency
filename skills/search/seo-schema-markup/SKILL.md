# Schema Markup

Implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results.

## What to establish about the page
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read first. Only ask for what's not covered.

1. **Page Type** - what kind of page, primary content, what rich results are possible
2. **Current State** - existing schema, implementation errors, rich results already appearing
3. **Goals** - which rich results are targeted, business value
4. **Data & Stack** - what data is available to populate the schema, tech stack (static, React/Next.js, CMS)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First

- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don't markup content that doesn't exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD

- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google's Guidelines

- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything

- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Multiple Schema Types

You can combine multiple schema types on one page using `@graph`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", ... },
    { "@type": "WebSite", ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... }
  ]
}
```

## Validation and Testing

### Tools

- **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
- **Search Console**: Enhancements reports

### Common Errors

**Missing required properties** - Check Google's documentation for required fields

**Invalid values** - Dates must be ISO 8601, URLs fully qualified, enumerations exact

**Mismatch with page content** - Schema doesn't match visible content

---

## Implementation

### Static Sites

- Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template
- Use includes/partials for reusable schema

### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js)

- Component that renders schema
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Serialize data to JSON-LD

### CMS / WordPress

- Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro)
- Theme modifications
- Custom fields to structured data

---

## Output Format

### Schema Implementation

```json
// Full JSON-LD code block
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "..."
  // Complete markup
}
```
