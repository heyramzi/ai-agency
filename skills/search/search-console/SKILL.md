# Google Search Console

Query GSC search analytics via the Search Console API using gcloud application-default credentials.

## Prerequisites

**A raw `curl` call needs `x-goog-user-project` or it 403s.** The client library reads the ADC
file's `quota_project_id`; curl does not, so it falls back to gcloud's shared project and returns a
403 that reads like a permissions error and is a quota-project error. `scripts/gsc.py` uses a
client library and picks the project up automatically; anything hand-rolled must pass the header.
Point it at the project that actually has `searchconsole.googleapis.com` enabled, which is not
necessarily the site's own GCP project. A project with the API switched off returns the same
403, so check the API is on before reading the error as a permissions problem.

**This skill is read-only by design.** Its auth uses `webmasters.readonly`. Submitting a sitemap
needs the full `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters` scope, so it takes an interactive
`gcloud auth application-default login` followed by
`gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project>`.

One-time auth setup (must include the `webmasters.readonly` scope):

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes=openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly
```

If the script returns a 403 scope error, prompt the user to re-run the auth command interactively via `! gcloud auth application-default login ...`.

## CLI Reference

The script at `scripts/gsc.py` provides all GSC queries:

```bash
GSC="python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/gsc.py"
```

### Commands

| Command                   | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `$GSC sites`              | List verified sites                         |
| `$GSC top-queries <site>` | Top queries by clicks                       |
| `$GSC top-pages <site>`   | Top pages by clicks                         |
| `$GSC query <site>`       | Custom query with dimensions                |
| `$GSC compare <site>`     | Compare current vs previous period          |
| `$GSC gaps <site>`        | Find high-impression, low-CTR opportunities |
| `$GSC orphans <site>`     | Queries you rank for with no page targeting them |
| `$GSC cannibals <site>`   | Queries split across two or more of your own pages |
| `$GSC inspect <site> <urls-file>` | Google's per-URL index verdict, in bulk |

Requesting a crawl is not in that table because it is not in the API. See below.

### Common Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--days 28`                 | Lookback period (default: 28 days)             |
| `--limit 50`                | Max rows returned                              |
| `--query-filter "notch"`    | Filter queries containing string               |
| `--page-filter "/blog/"`    | Filter pages containing string                 |
| `--dimensions "query,page"` | Dimensions: query, page, country, device, date |
| `--start-date 2026-01-01`   | Custom start date                              |
| `--end-date 2026-01-31`     | Custom end date                                |

`orphans` adds `--min-impressions` (default 100), `--max-coverage` (default 0.5) and
`--max-position` (default 30). `cannibals` adds `--min-impressions` (default 100) and
`--min-share` (default 0.15, the impression share a page needs to count as competing).
`inspect` adds `--out` (a JSON cache that resumes a stopped run), `--workers` (default 8)
and `--state` (print the URL list for coverage states matching a string).

## Asking Google to crawl a page

There is no API for it. The Indexing API accepts **only** `JobPosting` and `BroadcastEvent`
embedded in a `VideoObject`, confirmed against Google's own quickstart on 2026-08-31, so no
scope and no token reaches an ordinary page. The button in URL Inspection is the only route,
so it takes browser automation against a Chrome that is already signed in to the property.

**The quota is 13 URLs a day per property**, measured rather than read: the fourteenth
request on 2026-08-31 returned "Quota Exceeded ... try submitting this again tomorrow". Stop the
run on that message rather than burning the rest of the list against it.

Three things cost a run each. Handle all three in whatever script drives the console.

- **`/search-console/inspect?...&id=<page url>` is a 404.** The `id` is an opaque hash Google
  mints for the query, so an inspection cannot be deep-linked. Type into the box instead:
  `input[aria-label^="Inspect any URL"]`, and use `fillInput`, because `typeText` into that
  field leaves the page on Overview.
- **The console never unmounts a previous inspection**, so after three URLs the document holds
  four `REQUEST INDEXING` buttons and "click the first one" resubmits a page already done. A
  full navigation back to the property root between URLs is what makes the run trustworthy; refuse
  to click unless exactly one button is on the page.
- **No backslash may appear inside an injected template literal.** The outer template eats it
  before the string reaches the page, so `split('\n')` arrives as a real newline and the
  expression dies with "Invalid or unexpected token". Match on text in the page, and do the
  whitespace work in Node.

A request is a queue position, never an indexing decision. It is worth spending only on pages
a crawl would actually reward, and it does nothing about *why* Google was not fetching them:
for that, read `references/indexed-url-audit.md` and check what links to the page.

## Workflows

Every workflow, from the orphan sweep to the cannibalisation check: [`references/workflows.md`](references/workflows.md).

Auditing which URLs Google actually has indexed against the routes that exist, and fixing the
difference in `hooks.server.ts` and `vercel.json`: [`references/indexed-url-audit.md`](references/indexed-url-audit.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Error                   | Fix                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 403 insufficient scopes | Re-run `gcloud auth application-default login` with `--scopes` flag from Prerequisites |

| No sites found          | Add and verify the site at search.google.com/search-console                            |
| Empty results           | Check date range (GSC data has a 3-day lag)                                            |
