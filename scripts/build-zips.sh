# Regenerates zips/<skill>.zip, one zip per skill folder, and rewrites the
# `skills` array in .claude-plugin/plugin.json.
#
# Skills live one folder per area, `skills/<area>/<skill>/`, and a nested folder
# is not discovered on its own: the plugin manifest has to name every one. A
# hand-kept list of forty is a list that goes stale in silence, which is the exact
# failure this repo exists to make visible, so it is generated here instead.
#
# Claude Code installs skills from this repo as a plugin and never needs the zips.
# Claude Cowork and claude.ai take one file per skill through Settings > Skills >
# Add > Upload a skill, so a non-technical member needs a file they can download
# and upload as-is. The uploader accepts .zip and .skill (both must contain a
# SKILL.md) and a bare .md whose YAML frontmatter carries name and description.
# The zip is flat inside, `<skill>/SKILL.md`, because the area is a fact about
# this repo and not about the skill.
#
# Run this after any change under skills/ and commit the result.
